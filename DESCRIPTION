Title: Log Fold Change Distribution Tools for Working with Ratios of
        Counts
Version: 0.2.2
Author: Florian Erhard
Maintainer: Florian Erhard <florian.erhard@uni-wuerzburg.de>
Description: Ratios of count data such as obtained from RNA-seq are modelled
    using Bayesian statistics to derive posteriors for effects sizes. This
    approach is described in Erhard & Zimmer (2015) <doi:10.1093/nar/gkv696> 
    and Erhard (2018) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty471>.
